#' Given a distance matrix (symmetrical or not) and weighting function, 
#' calculate a spatial weights matrix with various ways of handling row-sums
#' 
#' @title Calculate spatial weights matrices.
#' @param x A matrix or distance object representing pairwise distances. The
#' distances need not be symmetrical.
#' @param bw A number representing the bandwidth within neighbors are considered.
#' If \code{mode = 'adaptive'}, \code{bw} is the number of nearest neighbors. If \code{mode = 'fixed'},
#' \code{bw} is the radius of the window in the map units.
#' @param mode One of \code{'adaptive'}, which considers a \code{bw} number of nearest 
#' neighbors; or \code{'fixed'}, which considers a fixed bandwidth window of radius \code{bw}.
#' @param weighting One of \code{'membership'}, which considers binary membership 
#' such that neighbors are weighted 1 and non-neighbors 0; \code{'distance'} which 
#' weighs neighbors according to \code{FUN} with the raw distance matrix providing the
#' distance; or \code{'rank'} which uses the rank-distance (i.e. 1 for nearest neighbor,
#' 2 for second nearest...) as the distance variable.
#' @param FUN The distance function. Default is \code{NULL} for \code{'membership'}, and
#' \code{function(x) 1/(offset + x)} otherwise. 
#' @param inf.val When singularities arise, (i.e. whenever the value is 1/0), by what value are
#' they replaced? Default is the \code{FUN} of the lowest non-\code{minval} value.
#' @param offset What value is added to the denominator to prevent singularities from arising
#' (e.g. whenever the value is 1/0)? Larger values imply smaller distance-decay. 
#' Default is \code{offset = 0}.
#' @param minval When distances are raw, what is the minimum allowable distance?
#' Default is \code{-Inf}. 
#' @param row.stand Logical or \code{'fuzzy'}. If \code{TRUE} (the default), rows are standardized such 
#' that they sum to one. If \code{'fuzzy'}, rows are standardized as a proportion of the 
#' largest value. 
#' @param clear.mem Logical. Should \code{\link[base]{gc}} be run in the middle of the 
#' calculation? Default is \code{clear.mem} but set as \code{TRUE} if memory limits are a concern. 
#' @importFrom data.table as.data.table
#' @importFrom data.table set
#' @return A matrix of dimensions \code{length(x) x length(x)}.
