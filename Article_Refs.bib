  abstract = {This is the third in a series of four papers examining the link between the energetics and mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. It reports measurements of the mechanical work required (ECM,tot) to lift and reaccelerate an animal’s centre of mass within each step as a function of speed and body size during level, constant average speed locomotion. A force platform was used in this study to measure ECM,tot for small bipeds, quadrupeds and hoppers. We have already published similar data from large animals. The total power required to lift and reaccelerate the centre of mass (ĖCM,tot) increased nearly linearly with speed for all the animals. Expressed in mass-specific terms, it was independent of body size and could be expressed by a simple equation :where ĖCM,tot/Mb has the units of W kg−1 and vg is speed in m s−1.Walking involves the same pendulum-like mechanism in small animals as has been described in humans and large animals. Also, running, trotting and hopping produce similar curves of ECM,tot as a function of time during a stride for both the small and large animals. Galloping, however, appears to be different in small and large animals. In small animals the front legs are used mainly for braking, while the back legs are used to reaccelerate the Centre of mass within a stride. In large animals the front and hind legs serve to both brake and reaccelerate the animal; this difference in mechanics is significant in that it does not allow the utilization of elastic energy in the legs of small animals, but does in the legs of large animals.},

  abstract = {The Gini index underestimates inequality for heavy-tailed distributions: for example, a Pareto distribution with exponent 1.5 (which has infinite variance) has the same Gini index as any exponential distribution (a mere 0.5). This is because the Gini index is relatively robust to extreme observations: while a statistic’s robustness to extremes is desirable for data potentially distorted by outliers, it is misleading for heavy-tailed distributions, which inherently exhibit extremes. We propose an alternative inequality index: the variance normalized by the second moment. This ratio is more stable (hence more reliable) for large samples from an infinite-variance distribution than the Gini index paradoxically. Moreover, the new index satisfies the normative axioms of inequality measurement; notably, it is decomposable into inequality within and between subgroups, unlike the Gini index.},

  abstract = {We examine two prevailing, yet surprisingly contradictory, theories of human walking. The six determinants of gait are kinematic features of gait proposed to minimize the energetic cost of locomotion by reducing the vertical displacement of the body center of mass (COM). The inverted pendulum analogy proposes that it is beneficial for the stance leg to behave like a pendulum, prescribing a more circular arc, rather than a horizontal path, for the COM. Recent literature presents evidence against the six determinants theory, and a simple mathematical analysis shows that a flattened COM trajectory in fact increases muscle work and force requirements. A similar analysis shows that the inverted pendulum fares better, but paradoxically predicts no work or force requirements. The paradox may be resolved through the dynamic walking approach, which refers to periodic gaits produced almost entirely by the dynamics of the limbs alone. Demonstrations include passive dynamic walking machines that descend a gentle slope, and active dynamic walking robots that walk on level ground. Dynamic walking takes advantage of the inverted pendulum mechanism, but requires mechanical work to transition from one pendular stance leg to the next. We show how the step-to-step transition is an unavoidable energetic consequence of the inverted pendulum gait, and gives rise to predictions that are experimentally testable on humans and machines. The dynamic walking approach provides a new perspective, focusing on mechanical work rather than the kinematics or forces of gait. It is helpful for explaining human gait features in a constructive rather than interpretive manner.},

This geolocalized data represents the selection of hike activities according to subjective and objective factors such as personal goals, personal abilities, trail conditions or weather conditions. In our approach, human mobility patterns are analysed from trajectories which are generated by hikers. We propose the generation of the trail network identifying special points in the overlap of trajectories. Trail crossings and trailheads define our network and shape topological features. We analyse the trail network of Balearic Islands, as a case of study, using complex weighted network theory. The analysis is divided into the four seasons of the year to observe the impact of weather conditions on the network topology. The number of visited places does not decrease despite the large difference in the number of samples of the two seasons with larger and lower activity. It is in summer season where it is produced the most significant variation in the frequency and localization of activities from inland regions to coastal areas. Finally, we compare our model with other related studies where the network possesses a different purpose. One finding of our approach is the detection of regions with relevant importance where landscape interventions can be applied in function of the communities.},
