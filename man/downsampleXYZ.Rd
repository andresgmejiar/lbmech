\title{Downsample high-resolution GPS data}
\usage{
downsampleXYZ(
  data,
  t_step,
  t_cut = t_step * 10,
  x = "x",
  y = "y",
  z = NULL,
  t = "t",
  ID = "ID"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or something coercible to a data.table containing
all observations}

\item{t_step}{The smallest allowable median time interval between observations.
Any track with a median value below this will be resampled to a track of 
equally-spaced observations with time difference \code{t_step}. This should
be selected based on the parameters that will be used to generate a
\code{world} object such that each successive step is likely to fall outside
of the range of possible raster transitions. For example, for a given source
\code{dem} in \code{\link[lbmech]{makeGrid}}, a given \code{distances = 16} in
\code{\link[lbmech]{makeWorld}} (implying that \code{contiguity = 2}), and 
an estimated animal maximum velocity of \code{v_max = 1.5} m/s, t_step
should be at least \code{t_step = res(dem) / v_max * (contiguity + 1) * sqrt(2)}}

\item{t_cut}{A numeric. Any gap exceeding this value in seconds in a given
track will be treated as the start of a new segment. Default is \code{t_step * 10}.}

\item{x}{A character string representing the data column containing the 'x'
coordinates in any projection.}

\item{y}{A character string representing the data column containing the 'y'
coordinates in any projection.}

\item{z}{Optional. A character string representing the data column containing 
the 'z' elevations.}

\item{t}{A character string representing the data column containing the time
values, either as a numeric of successive seconds or as a date time string}

\item{ID}{A character string representing the data column containing the
unique ID for each observed trajectory. In other words, each set of points
for each continuous observation for each observed individual would merit a
unique id.}
}
\value{
A data.table, containing the original input data but with all 
overly-high resolution tracks downsampled to an acceptable rate of observations
and column names prepared for the \code{\link[lbmech]{getVelocity}} function.
}
\description{
Downsample high-resolution *(x,y,t)* or *(x,y,z,t)* data
to match a minimum spatial resolution.
}
\examples{
# Generate fake data with x,y coordinates, z elevation, and a t
# column representing the number of seconds into the observation
data <- data.table(x = runif(10000,10000,20000),
                   y = runif(10000,30000,40000),
                   z = runif(10000,0,200),
                   t = 1:1000,
                   ID = rep(1:10,each=1000))
                   
# Set the minimum value at 3 seconds
data <- downsampleXYZ(data = data, t_step = 3, z = 'z')
