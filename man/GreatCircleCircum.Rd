\usage{
GreatCircleCircum(lon, lat, b, n = 72)
}
\arguments{
\item{lon}{Numeric. A known longitude along a Great Circle.}

\item{lat}{Numeric. A known latitude along a Great circle}

\item{b}{Numeric. The initial bearing defining the Great Circle}

\item{n}{How many points along the great circle should be modeled? More points
results in higher precision. Default is \code{n = 72}}
}
